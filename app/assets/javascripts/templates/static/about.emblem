h1 About us

h2.ta-center Mission

p.mb-l.italic.ta-center CivicSourcing is committed to increasing civic engagement, participation and collaboration in pursuit of a more democratic society, one community at a time.

p.mb At CivicSourcing we believe, that as members of a democratic society, we have the opportunity, responsibility and authority to contribute to the decisions that affect us and the communities in which we live. However, research has consistently shown that only a relatively small percentage of people actively participate in the democratic process â€“ influencing the decision that affect all of us. The current state of democracy in America is broken and the civic health of our nation is in critical condition.

p.mb CivicSourcing offers a new way to get involved and affect change. We not only provide an accessible place for individuals to voice what matters most to them, but also empower individuals to plug in to their community and work collaboratively to find solutions to problems, generate ideas, realize opportunities and affect change using a toolkit of civic actions including petitioning, pledging, volunteering and civicfunding. Through CivicSourcing, any individual can find ways to contribute and work together with his or her community.
